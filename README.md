Here is a short gameplay.

## Notes

* This code is written to have a low tech debt except the UI part, it needs to be replaced to a third party library.

* It almost meets the original requirements and is made to be easy to change (maintainability, extensibility) and easy to understand (readability, formatting, clarity) but lacks of proper documentation.

* This project is currently paused until I decide how to translate this in a web app or made a separate app for mobile and web version and after I find other experienced java developers interested in this project.

* The code as well the commits were written in Esperanto, I will translate them when I have time to invest in this project.

## Know Issues
See [issues section](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Tanks-game/issues)
