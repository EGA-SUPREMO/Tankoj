# Tankoj!
A relative-complex tanks game
------

Everything made from scratch from the graphics engine to the UI ~~BIG mistake btw~~ and designs except the backgrounds.

Similar to [Worms inc](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70640/Worms/).

[RPG Game Template](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/RPG-Game-template) made possible this game.

## Gameplay
In this turn-based game, the first player aims, set the potency, and fire! then next tank until every player has shot, then it begins the next turn, the last tank with health points wins the battle and can use the points it earned through the match to buy different missiles, force shields, and upgrade its stats like resistance, speed, HP, gasoline, etc, for the next battle.

## Notes
* The code was written with the principle of performace above readability or clarity, e.g. it uses unidimensional arrays for bidimensional arrays, [see here how it's possible](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Tankoj/blob/master/pixelarray2d.jpg).

* This code is written to have a low tech debt except the UI part, it needs to be replaced to a third party library.

* It almost meets the original requirements and is made to be easy to change (maintainability, extensibility) and easy to understand (readability, formatting, clarity) but lacks of proper documentation.

* This project is currently paused until I decide how to translate this in a web app or made a separate app for mobile and web version and after I find other experienced java developers interested in this project.

* The code as well the commits were written in Esperanto, I will translate them when I have time to invest in this project.

## Known Issues
See [issues section](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Tanks-game/issues)

## TODOs
* Use a third-party UI library instead of reinventing the wheel.

* Use a bug tracker instead of a text file.

* Add music.

* Add animations, especially the explosions.

* Add sound effects.

* Improve a bit the game's physics.

* Make an usable IU.

* Make proper documentation for make faster to hunt developers.

* Add automated tests.
